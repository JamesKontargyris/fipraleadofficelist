    <h2>Fipra Lead Office List - Login Details</h2>

    <p>Dear {{ $first_name }},</p>

    <p><strong>Login Info:</strong> you, as a Special Adviser have access to <strong>view</strong> the full lead office list and to <strong>edit</strong> your own client information.</p>

    <p>Follow this link to access the online Lead office list sytem <a href="http://leadofficelist.fipra.com">http://leadofficelist.fipra.com</a><br/>Please bookmark it for future use.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Your login:</strong> {{ $email }} <br/>
        <strong>Your password:</strong> your surname with capital first letter <br/>
        <em>Please log in as soon as possible and add your clients to this system.</em>
    </p>

    <p>When you log in you will see the <strong>full</strong> Lead Office list sorted by Client. From this screen you can sort the list by sector, by service, by Lead and by Account Director to talk to just by using the filter drop-down buttons. You can also navigate between views (ie how many you want to see on a page, show dormant clients etc)</p>

    <p>Navigating the tabs across the top left hand side of the screen, brings you to an explanatory note (<strong>About the List</strong>) about the Lead Office List and to the <strong>Your Clients</strong> tab.</p>

    <p>I draw your attention to the <strong>About the List</strong> tab prior to making any changes to the system. This gives a full overview of what it's all about.</p>

    <p><strong>So what do we need from you?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the Your Clients tab</li>
        <li>For first time log in, please add your clients to create your list. Click the <strong>Add a Client</strong> button on the top left hand corner (under Your Clients). Use the tab key to navigate quickly through the fields. Please remember to include a comment. When you have completed the form just click the <strong>Add</strong> button</li>
        <li>To make a client dormant click the make dormant button which is under Toggle Status.</li>
        <li>At any time you can log in and just click the <strong>Your Clients</strong> tab to view, add, edit or update your portion of the Lead office list.</li>
        <li>Here you find an alphabetical list of your listed clients.</li>
        <li>Click on the client name to see what information is stored in the system. Use the <strong>Go Back</strong> button to go back to your list.</li>
        <li>To edit the information held you can use the <strong>Edit this Client</strong> button or from the main view use the pencil button which is under Actions.</li>
        <li>Simply click <strong>Go Back</strong> to return to your list.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> There is no option to delete a client as we wish to create a full history just mark a client as Dormant if you no longer work with them.</em></p>

    <p><strong>When do we need this? <br/>
    We ask you to update your information by close of business Friday June 5th so that we can proceed with creating reports to share prior to the Network meeting.</strong></p>

    <p>For your convenience please find a printable, quick guide attached with step by step instructions on how to use the system.</p>
