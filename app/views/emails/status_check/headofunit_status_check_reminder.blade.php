		<h2>Fipra Lead Office List</h2>
		<h3>Please check your lead office list information</h3>

		<p>Dear {{ $first_name }},</p>

        <p>As a Head of Unit, and in preparation for the upcoming Network meeting in Brussels in May, I ask you to visit
            <a href="http://leadofficelist.fipra.com/clients">leadofficelist.fipra.com/clients</a> in the next week in order to confirm and update the information we hold for the clients you have listed for your Unit.</p>

        <p>The information you provide gives us our overall network-wide statistics.</p>

        <p>Simply log in with your Fipra email address and your Lead Office List password and you will be brought to the <b><i>Your Clients</i></b> tab to make your unit's additions and to change client status to dormant/active where required.</p>

        <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Please remember, the Lead Office List, information contained in our online system and any reports produced therein, is <b style="color:red;">STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL</b> to members of the Fipra Network and should be treated with the utmost discretion and confidentiality.</p>

        <p>If you'd like a reminder of your password or need any help at all, please don't hesitate to contact me.</p>

		<p>Many thanks,<br/>Claire</p>
