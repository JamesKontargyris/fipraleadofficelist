		<h2>Fipra Lead Office List</h2>

		<p>Dear {{ $first_name }},</p>

        <p>As you will know, we have for over 10 years requested that all Fipra Units list their clients on our "lead office list" which was, last year, turned from a paper based system into a handy App to which everyone in Fipra including all Special Advisers have access.
        </p>

        <p>This information has proven very useful not only to find connections to and advise about potential client companies but also to help spot and manage conflicts as we all work for different interests. In short it is a list of who to call about who. Please note that the app contains all clients serviced since 2007, simply marking those that have not been billed in the last 3 months as dormant. You can therefore look up all current and past relationships.</p>

        <p>Up until now, we have not routinely asked all Special Advisers to declare their clients for this list in the same way, which created a blind spot in the system that we recently noticed.
        </p>

        <p>From this month therefore, we are asking you to declare any clients you may be serving in a personal capacity so that these show up here. The idea is to be super up-to-date by our Washington meeting - though please note the list is live and you can make any of your contacts active or dormant as circumstances change.
        </p>

        <p>As a Special Adviser, please therefore visit and familiarise yourself once more with <a href="http://leadofficelist.fipra.com">leadofficelist.fipra.com</a></p>

        <p>In the next five working days please ADD any other fee paying clients you may have to the system.</p>

        <p>You will shortly receive an email with your log-in details and further information about navigating and using the system.</p>

        <p>You can visit <a href="http://leadofficelist.fipra.com">leadofficelist.fipra.com</a> at any time in order to view the list.</p>

        <p><strong>Please note that the Lead Office List, information contained in our online app and any reports produced therein, is <span style="color:red;">STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL</span> to members of the Fipra Network and should be treated with the utmost discretion and confidentiality.</strong></p>

        <p>If you need any help at all, please don't hesitate to contact me. </p>

		<p>Many thanks,<br/>Claire</p>
