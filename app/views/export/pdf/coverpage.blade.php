    <p>This app and the list is contains are <strong>confidential</strong> to members of the Fipra Network. They are <strong>under no circumstances</strong> to be used externally and you share in this responsibility.</p>

    <p><strong>This is NOT a client list</strong> – it is not even a list of clients served by the Fipra brand as many of the companies below are serviced under local unit names such as RLMFinsbury, CEC, First House, Six Year Plan etc. Additionally it lists other clients served by individual Special Advisers in their own right.</p>

    <p>This list serves as a tool to help you identify who has the “lead” on current clients/projects - and therefore which Unit or Special Adviser has a relationship with firms you may be speaking to.</p>

    <p>In most cases, only one unit has the lead and therefore a direct contractual relationship exists. Where two units, or a Unit and a Spad for example, in different jurisdictions have a contract with the same client, this is indicated by a link  icon and the country initials or the Special Adviser initials (proceeded by sa-) and multiple entries are made. <strong>However, we do not duplicate clients of a unit that are subcontracted from another Fipra unit.</strong></p>

    <p>The list contains ALL clients since 2007. Usefully, you can find past clients too. They are referred to as “Dormant clients” (i.e. clients not billed in the last three months). By searching the network’s dormant clients you can discover who might have a past relationship or information about a company that you may wish to speak to.</p>

    <p>This list contains <strong>no new business in development (NBD)</strong>. Included are only current and past clients. It also does not double account by showing clients that are subcontracted by one network member to another one.</p>

    <p>On rare occasions there are two members of the network listed as working for the same company – usually they would be reporting to different parts of that company and have separate contractual relationships.</p>

    <p>We take conflicts seriously and sometimes these force hard commercial decisions. This list is our principal tool to refer to when pitching to new clients in any consideration of possible client conflicts within the Fipra group. It tells you if someone else is working for a competitor of your client – a fact of which you must be aware in order to be able to manage it.</p>

    <p>This app is not, however, a definitive guide to conflicts. To obtain certainty on conflict questions please refer to the Account Director or Spad listed and where necessary to the Fipra Group Chairman who will help resolve conflict issues with you.</p>

    <p>Please therefore, <strong>always</strong> refer to this app before signing up a client. Listed here are national clients as well as cross border clients to minimise “crossed wires” and to ensure we are co-ordinated at all times.</p>

    <p>Where possible, please do not contact or communicate with a client of another unit independently without a courtesy conversation beforehand with the relevant Account Director or Spad listed who may have useful tips for you. In this way all of our contacts are at the disposal of everyone in the Network with the minimum controls necessary to put on a united image as a single Fipra Network! As a matter of courtesy, any unit carrying out New Business Development (NBD) activity or work in the “territory” of another unit, while free to do so, should, let the relevant home unit know where possible.</p>

    <p>The aim is that all <strong>cross-border</strong> business with other units in this network is done under the growing Fipra brand. National and local work can be done under either Fipra or your home brand. However it is of value to you, and to all in the Network, that clients that know you under your home brand, should be made aware of your membership of Fipra because this itself, will create new opportunities for work. Fipra International can assist with visiting cards, stationary or development of your website where you may wish to advertise this fact.</p>

    <p>Claire Kavanagh (<a href="mailto:claire.kavanagh@fipra.com">claire.kavanagh@fipra.com</a>) is your point of contact for any enquiries relating to this app. <strong>Please go through your entries carefully.It is important that your entries are complete, up-to-date and accurate</strong> to be of value. Search for your clients and find out who else has had dealings with them in the past or is doing so today. Please study this list again ahead of your attendance at Fipra Network Meetings in order to prompt conversations on current clients and the many opportunities of our Network that can arise with colleagues generally during the Network Meetings.</p>
