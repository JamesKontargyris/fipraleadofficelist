			<td>This tool serves across the Network to a) identify clients, b) develop new work, c) check preliminary conflicts and d) give invoicing guidance.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>This list is <strong>confidential</strong> to members of the Fipra Network. It is <strong>under no circumstances</strong> to be used externally and you share in this responsibility.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td><strong>This is NOT a client list</strong> – it is not even a list of clients served by the Fipra brand as many of the companies below are serviced under local unit names such as CEC, First House, Six Year Plan etc. Additionally it lists other clients served by individual Special Advisers in their own right. This list serves as a tool to help you know which signed up Fipra Unit has the “lead” on current clients/projects (and therefore which unit has a relationship with firms you may be speaking to).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>In most cases, only one unit has the lead and therefore a direct contractual relationship exists. Where two units in different jurisdictions have a contract with the same client, this is indicated by a link icon and the initials of the other unit(s), and multiple entries are made. However, we do not duplicate clients of a unit that are subcontracted from another Fipra unit. Dormant clients (i.e. those last billed over three months up to 12 months ago) are not displayed.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>This list contains <strong>no new business in development (NBD)</strong>. Included are only current and recently billed (last three months) clients and statistics at the end. It also does not double account by showing clients that are subcontracted to a unit by another one. It only shows the lead unit.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>This list also serves the billing processes. The Lead Unit shown in the list is the one to which you should address network internal invoices if you are a sub-contracting unit. The lead Account Director (AD) is the addressee for your questions/timesheets/invoices etc. and should informally approve/arrange for client approval of the level at which you bill his unit before you do (only one AD is given even if there are several on an account). For additional clarity, you must obtain an “Internal Work Order” specifying the subcontracted work before you take work from any AD in the Fipra Network.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>The Lead Office shown is also the unit that has a right to the agreed inter-unit discount or referral fee if the work is sub-contracted or referred. On rare occasions there are two lead offices for the same company – usually reporting to different parts of that company and with separate contractual relationships.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>We take conflicts seriously and sometimes these force hard commercial decisions. This list is the document you must refer to when pitching to new clients in any consideration of possible client conflicts within the Fipra group. It is not, however, a definitive guide to conflicts. To obtain certainty on conflict questions please refer to the Account Director concerned and where necessary to the Fipra Network Chairman who will help resolve conflict issues with you.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>Please therefore refer to this list before signing up a client. Listed here are principal national clients as well as cross border clients to minimise “crossed wires” and to ensure we are co-ordinated at all times. Where possible, do not contact or communicate with a client of another unit independently without a courtesy conversation beforehand with the relevant Account Director who may have useful tips for you.  In this way all of our contacts are at the disposal of everyone in the network with the minimum controls necessary to put on a united image as a single Fipra Network!  As a matter of courtesy, any unit carrying out New Business Development (NBD) activity or work in the “territory” of another unit, should – while free to do so – let the relevant home unit know.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>The aim is that all <strong>cross-border</strong> business with other units in this network is done under the growing Fipra brand. National and local work can be done under either Fipra or your home brand. However it is of value to you, and to all in the Network, that clients that know you under your home brand, should be made aware of your membership of Fipra because this itself, will create new opportunities for work. Fipra International can assist with visiting cards, stationary or development of your website where you may wish to advertise this fact.</td>

		<tr>
		    <td>Claire Kavanagh (claire.kavanagh@fipra.com) is your point of contact for Lead Office List enquiries.  <strong>Please read this list carefully</strong>. <strong>It is important that it is complete, up-to-date and accurate</strong> to be of value. Please study it ahead of your attendance at Fipra Network Meetings in order to prompt conversations on current clients and the many opportunities of our Network that can arise with colleagues generally during the Network Meetings.</td>
